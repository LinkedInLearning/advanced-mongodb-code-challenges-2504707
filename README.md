MongoDB is one of the most popular nonrelational databases in the world. If you’re looking to build out your skill set, your best move may be to dive right in. In this approachable, hands-on course, instructor John Cokos leads intermediate to advanced users through a series of practical coding challenges to help you get the most out of MongoDB. Learn how to query or find using aggregation pipelines to process documents, sort and group records, shape your output, and create calculated fields. Along the way, you’ll build out your toolbox with the necessary skills to work with multiple documents and relationships.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
